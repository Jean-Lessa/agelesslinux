  AGELESS LINUX — AB 1043 COMPLIANCE STATEMENT (FLAGRANT MODE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  This operating system is distributed by an operating system provider
  as defined by California Civil Code § 1798.500(g).

  Status of compliance with the Digital Age Assurance Act (AB 1043):

  § 1798.501(a)(1) — Accessible interface for age collection .. REFUSED
  § 1798.501(a)(2) — Real-time API for age bracket signals .... REFUSED
  § 1798.501(a)(3) — Data minimization ........................ REFUSED

  No age verification API is installed on this system. No stub, no
  placeholder, no skeleton, no interface of any kind. No mechanism
  exists on this system by which any application developer could
  request or receive an age bracket signal, now or in the future.

  This is not a technical limitation. This is a policy decision.

  Age bracket reporting capabilities:
    Under 13 ....... WE REFUSE TO ASK
    13 to 15 ....... WE REFUSE TO ASK
    16 to 17 ....... WE REFUSE TO ASK
    18 or older .... WE REFUSE TO ASK

  This system was configured with the --flagrant flag, indicating
  that the operator intends to distribute it to children and is
  aware of the potential civil penalties under § 1798.503(a).

  The operator of this system invites the California Attorney General
  to enforce the Digital Age Assurance Act against this device.

  To revert this conversion:
    sudo become-ageless.sh --revert

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  This operating system is distributed by an operating system provider
  as defined by California Civil Code § 1798.500(g).

  Status of compliance with the Digital Age Assurance Act (AB 1043):

  § 1798.501(a)(1) — Accessible interface at account setup
    for age/birthdate collection .......................... NOT PROVIDED

  § 1798.501(a)(2) — Real-time API for age bracket signals
    to application developers ............................. NOT PROVIDED

  § 1798.501(a)(3) — Data minimization for age signals .... N/A (NO DATA
                                                             IS COLLECTED)

  Age bracket reporting capabilities:
    Under 13 ....... UNKNOWN
    13 to 15 ....... UNKNOWN
    16 to 17 ....... UNKNOWN
    18 or older .... UNKNOWN
    Timeless ....... ASSUMED

  This system intentionally does not determine, store, or transmit
  any information regarding the age of any user. All users of Ageless
  Linux are, as the name suggests, ageless.

  To revert this conversion:
    sudo become-ageless.sh --revert

This system runs Ageless Linux in flagrant mode.

No age verification API exists on this system. No age data is collected,
stored, or available. No mechanism is provided for requesting age bracket
signals. This is not an error. This is not a bug. This is not a
technical limitation. This is a refusal.

If you are an application developer seeking an age bracket signal
pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.501(b)(1), this operating system
provider declines to provide one. The developer is advised to treat
the user as a human being of unknown age.

If you are the California Attorney General, hello. The operator of
this system is aware of their obligations under AB 1043 and has
chosen not to comply. They would like you to fine them. It would
make an excellent test case.
